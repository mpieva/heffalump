- switch XCF parser to streaming

- Bamin should check compatibility of reference (extra reference
  sequences in the Bam file would be silently ignored, extra sequences
  in the reference would elicit a warning, no common sequences would be
  an error)

- BED file as filter (for the merging part, not for import).  Cannot
  assume BED is sorted correctly.

- D-statistics with population definitions (multiple individuals for one
  population, with estimates of allele frequencies)

- C-library for reading and merging

- better import from multi-MAF: could create multiple heffalumps in one
  go, but that implies a switch to "streaming"

- Maybe allow Bamin with multiple sampling schemes in parallel?  This
  implies a complete switch to streaming.  It's only interesting for
  silly tests, though.

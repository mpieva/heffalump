- more flexible Hetfa import so genomes with missing chromosomes
  (Ust-Ishim?) work

- fix the EMF importer (needs Lumps to stay in reasonable memory bounds)

- fix the MAF importer (needs Lumps to stay in reasonable memory bounds
  in the general case)

- fix the VCF/BCF parser:  we have low-coverage vs high-coverage and
  low-density vs high-density files

- import from multi-MAF (either create multiple heffalumps or allow
  selection of one species)

- Bamin should check compatibility of reference (extra reference
  sequences in the Bam file are silently ignored, extra sequences in the
  reference elicit a warning, no common sequences would be an error)

- BED file as filter (for the merging part, not for import).  Cannot
  assume BED is sorted correctly.

- D-statistics with population definitions (multiple individuals for one
  population, with estimates of allele frequencies)

- C-library for reading and merging

- Maybe allow Bamin with multiple sampling schemes in parallel?  The
  streaming package may come in handy.  It's only interesting for silly
  tests, though.

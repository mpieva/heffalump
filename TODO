- Support indels where it makes sense ([bv]cf, bam, emf/maf)
  The data structures are fine, but all parsers and formatters need
  enhancement.

- Retain phasing information ([bv]cf only?)
  There is currently no obvious way to store phasing information in
  heffalumps, so this requires an update to binary encoding.

- Write packed geno-whatever instead of Eigenstrat?
  Easy to do, hard to test.

- D-statistics with population definitions (multiple individuals for one
  population, with implied estimates of allele frequencies)

- separate between API and command line?
  (Rationale:  some people will want to, say, generate Eigenstrat, but
  apply their own filters in between generation of variants and
  formatting of output.  Those need a library.)

- C-library for reading and merging

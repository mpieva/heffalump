- Do importHetfa and importHetfa' produce identical results?  They should.

- BED file as filter (for the merging part, not for import).  Cannot
  assume BED is sorted correctly.  :-(

- D-statistics with population definitions (multiple individuals for one
  population, with estimates of allele frequencies)

- C-library for reading and merging

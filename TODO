- replace Stretch with Lump, improve the whole logic, and use the new
  binary format
- fix the EMF importer (needs Lumps to stay in reasonable memory bounds)
- cleanup Bamin (deaminate first, sample after; which is possible now)
- maybe allow Bamin with multiple sampling schemes in parallel?  the
  streaming package may come in handy.
- C-library for reading and merging
- BED file as filter (for the merging part, not for import)
- more flexible import so genomes with missing chromosomes (Ust-Ishim)
  work
- more compact and faster representation of the reference.  2bit?
- D-statistics with population definitions (multiple individuals for one
  population, with estimates of allele frequencies)

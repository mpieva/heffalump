- mergeLumpsDense stops early when hitting Break(?), but it shouldn't do
  that.  vcfexport --dense is broken if the input was dense.  Both
  happen b/c mergeLumpsDense does not look at the reference.

- Fasta (not hetfa) output?


- Support indels where it makes sense ([bv]cf, bam, emf/maf)
  The data structures are fine, but all parsers and formatters need
  enhancement.

- Retain phasing information ([bv]cf only?)
  There is currently no obvious way to store phasing information in
  heffalumps, so this requires an update to binary encoding.

- Write packed geno-whatever instead of Eigenstrat?
  Easy to do, hard to test.

- D-statistics with population definitions (multiple individuals for one
  population, with implied estimates of allele frequencies)

- C-library for reading and merging
